# klima - A ESP8266 based humidity and temperature sensor

Klima was developed after scraping past a massive overheating of servers
caused by an unnoticed air condition failure. To be able to install the sensor
without further actions an ESP8266 wireless module was choosen.  

## License rules

klima is provided under the terms of the CERN-OHL-S license version 2 as

SPDX license identifiers, which are machine parseable and considered legaly
equivalent.

The SPDX license identifier in klima shall be added at the first possible
line in a file which can contain a comment. This is normally the first line
except for scripts. Scripts require the #!PATH_TO_INTERPRETER tag in the
