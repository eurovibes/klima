# Welcome to the Prima Klima project

The Prima Klima project is an ESP8266 based sensor board to monitor
humidity and temperature. It was started after an unnoticed air contition
failure scraping past a massive server failing due to overheat.

## Fabrication
**klima** provides generic gerber files and fabrication data for JLCPCB and
Seeed Fusion PCB.

### Gerber
Gerber files can be downloaded [here](https://eurovibes.github.io/klima/Fabrication/gerber.zip).

### JLCPCB

## License rules

**klima** is provided under the terms of the CERN-OHL-S license version 2 as
provided in the LICENSES/CERN-OHL-S-2.0 file.

Instead of adding license boilerplates to the individual files, **klima**
uses SPDX license identifiers, which are machine parseable and considered
legaly equivalent.

The SPDX license identifier in klima shall be added at the first possible
line in a file which can contain a comment. This is normally the first line
except for scripts. Scripts require the #!PATH_TO_INTERPRETER tag in the
first line; place the SPDX identifier into the second line.

The SPDX license identifier is added in form of a comment.
